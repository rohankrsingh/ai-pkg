## v0.1.6 — Fix venv activation persistence & add Gemini retry/backoff

### Summary
This release fixes two user-facing issues discovered when running the CLI on Arch Linux:

- Ensure suggested environment steps (like `python -m venv .venv` + `source .venv/bin/activate`) are executed in the same shell so activation persists and subsequent commands (e.g., `pip install`) run inside the created venv instead of the system Python.
- Add a small retry + exponential backoff around the Google Gemini client call to handle transient 503 “model overloaded” errors before falling back to the REST path.

These changes reduce the PEP 668 (“externally-managed-environment”) errors on Arch and make the AI backend more resilient to temporary model overloads.

### Notable changes
- `src/ai_pkg/cli.py` — run all `env_steps` together in one bash shell and add failure handling.
- `src/ai_pkg/backends.py` — retry transient 503 server errors with exponential backoff before falling back to REST.

### Upgrade / usage notes
- Prefer running inside a virtual environment and install in editable mode for development:
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -e .
  ```
- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set or pass `--api-key` to the CLI.

### Files changed
- `src/ai_pkg/cli.py`
- `src/ai_pkg/backends.py`
